			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Next.js 14 Project with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ESLint, and Prettier",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into detailed steps covering: (1) Next.js 14 project initialization with TypeScript, (2) TailwindCSS installation and configuration, (3) ESLint and Prettier setup for both frontend and backend, (4) removal of default boilerplate and creation of a clean, scalable project structure (including app, components, styles, and API routes), (5) updating package.json scripts for fullstack workflows, (6) license and metadata configuration, and (7) initializing Git with a proper .gitignore. For each, specify commands, configuration file changes, and verification steps.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard but multi-faceted setup task for a modern Next.js 14 fullstack project. It requires knowledge of project scaffolding, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, linting/formatting tools, and best practices for project structure and version control. Each tool has its own configuration and integration steps, but the process is well-documented and follows established patterns. Complexity is moderate due to the need for cross-tool integration and ensuring a clean, scalable foundation.[1][2][4]"

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Design Supabase Database Schema and Configure Drizzle ORM",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into: (1) requirements analysis and ERD design, (2) schema definition for profiles and memos (including normalization, keys, and constraints), (3) Supabase migration scripts and version control, (4) Drizzle ORM model definitions with TypeScript types, (5) integration and type validation between Drizzle and Supabase, (6) documentation and ER diagrams, (7) test data and CRUD operation verification, and (8) schema change management for future evolution.",
			"reasoning": "Designing a robust relational schema and integrating it with Drizzle ORM in a Supabase environment involves both database and application-layer concerns. It requires careful planning for normalization, constraints, migrations, and type safety, as well as documentation and reproducibility. The need for versioned migrations, ER diagrams, and integration testing increases complexity above a basic schema setup."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Core UI Components and Responsive Layout with Accessibility Compliance",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: (1) component directory and naming conventions, (2) Header component with branding and navigation triggers, (3) Navigation component with keyboard and ARIA support, (4) Layout component with responsive grid/flexbox, (5) TailwindCSS responsive styling, (6) accessibility audits (WCAG 2.1 AA), (7) automated and manual accessibility testing, and (8) component documentation with usage and accessibility notes.",
			"reasoning": "Building foundational UI components with strict accessibility and responsive design requirements is moderately complex. It requires not only implementation but also adherence to WCAG standards, semantic HTML, ARIA, and responsive CSS. Testing and documentation are essential for maintainability and compliance, increasing the number of necessary subtasks."

		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Web Speech API for In-Browser Speech Recognition and Basic Voice Input",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) browser compatibility detection and fallback UI, (2) React hook/service for SpeechRecognition lifecycle, (3) event handling for speech recognition (onstart, onresult, onerror, onend), (4) microphone permission management and error handling, (5) accessible UI components for voice input, and (6) integration with memo creation/editing workflows.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating the Web Speech API is straightforward in supported browsers but requires careful handling of compatibility, permissions, and accessibility. The need for robust error handling, fallback messaging, and accessible UI increases the implementation scope, but the underlying APIs are well-documented and commonly used."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance and Prepare for Vercel Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) code splitting and dynamic imports, (2) image optimization with Next.js Image component, (3) Vercel deployment configuration (vercel.json, env vars, build scripts), (4) Vercel Edge Cache and ISR setup, (5) monitoring integration (Vercel Analytics, Sentry), (6) performance testing and Lighthouse audits, (7) deployment verification and rollback procedures, and (8) deployment and optimization documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Performance optimization and deployment for Next.js 14 on Vercel involves advanced configuration, code refactoring, and integration with platform-specific features (Edge Cache, ISR, analytics). Ensuring production readiness requires thorough testing, monitoring, and documentation, making this a moderately high-complexity task."

		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Voice Recording Interface with Real-Time Speech-to-Text and Editing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) UI design for recording controls and status, (2) MediaRecorder API integration for audio capture, (3) real-time speech-to-text transcription with Web Speech API, (4) editable transcript UI with undo/redo, (5) audio-transcript synchronization and playback controls, (6) error handling and accessibility, and (7) integration with memo workflows.",
			"reasoning": "Combining audio recording, real-time transcription, and editable UI with accessibility and error handling is moderately complex. It requires coordination between browser APIs, state management, and user experience design, as well as robust handling of permissions and browser differences."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Supabase Auth-Based Authentication System with Session Management and RLS",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Supabase Auth package installation and configuration, (2) signup/login UI and backend flows, (3) session management and persistence, (4) protected route implementation, (5) user-data linkage via auth.users, (6) RLS policy definition and enforcement, (7) error handling and edge case management, (8) documentation of flows and policies, and (9) automated and manual security testing.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a secure, full-featured authentication system with session management and RLS involves both frontend and backend integration, security policy definition, and robust error handling. Ensuring correct linkage between auth.users and application data, as well as comprehensive documentation and testing, increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate and Configure Anthropic Claude API (API Key, Basic Integration, Env Management, Security)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Anthropic SDK installation and dependency management, (2) secure API key storage and environment variable setup, (3) service module for Claude client initialization, (4) backend API routes for memo AI features, (5) security best practices (access control, input validation, error handling), and (6) integration and troubleshooting documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating a third-party AI API with secure key management and backend routing is a standard backend integration task. Security and documentation are critical, but the process is well-supported by SDKs and best practices, keeping complexity moderate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Accessibility and Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance",
			"complexityScore": 7,
