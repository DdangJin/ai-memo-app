			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate and Configure Anthropic Claude API (API Key, Basic Integration, Env Management, Security)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by breaking down the integration into: (1) SDK installation and verification, (2) secure API key management and environment configuration, (3) service module implementation for Claude client, (4) development of secure API routes for memo summarization/classification, (5) application of security best practices (auth, input validation, error handling), and (6) comprehensive documentation for integration and security.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves secure integration of a third-party AI API, environment variable management, backend service abstraction, secure API route development, and documentation. Each area requires careful attention to security, error handling, and maintainability. Industry best practices dictate separation of concerns and explicit documentation for future maintainers. The task is moderately complex due to the need for secure key handling, backend/frontend separation, and adherence to security standards, but is well-scoped with clear subtasks."

			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Web Speech API for In-Browser Speech Recognition and Basic Voice Input",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by dividing it into: (1) browser compatibility detection and fallback messaging, (2) implementation of a reusable React hook/service for SpeechRecognition lifecycle, (3) event handling for speech recognition (onstart, onresult, onerror, onend), (4) microphone permission management and error feedback, (5) accessible and responsive UI for voice input, and (6) documentation of browser support and integration guidelines.",
			"reasoning": "The task requires integrating a browser-native API with known compatibility limitations, managing permissions, handling asynchronous events, and ensuring accessibility. While the Web Speech API is straightforward in supported browsers, robust error handling, permission management, and accessibility add moderate complexity. Best practices require modularization (hook/service), clear user feedback, and comprehensive documentation for cross-browser support."

			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Header and Navigation Components into Main Page with Auth-Aware UI and Layout Consistency",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by splitting it into: (1) refactoring app/page.tsx to use Header and Navigation components, (2) integrating the Layout component for consistent structure, (3) implementing authentication-aware UI logic for navigation and header, and (4) ensuring accessibility and responsive design compliance.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard UI refactor task involving component composition, conditional rendering based on authentication state, and ensuring accessibility. The complexity is moderate due to the need for auth-aware UI and layout consistency, but the patterns are well-established in React/Next.js projects."

		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Layout Component into Memo Page for Consistent UI Experience",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by breaking it into: (1) analyzing and removing redundant layout code from the memo page, (2) integrating the shared Layout, Header, and Navigation components, and (3) verifying and adjusting memo-specific styling and responsive behavior.",
			"reasoning": "This is a focused UI refactor to ensure layout consistency. The main complexity lies in identifying and removing redundant code and ensuring the page works seamlessly with the shared layout. This is a common pattern in React/Next.js projects and does not involve complex logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Layout Component into Authentication Pages for Consistent UI",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by dividing it into: (1) analyzing current authentication page layouts and identifying elements to preserve, (2) integrating the shared Layout component with a simplified variant for auth flows, (3) updating navigation and branding for consistency, and (4) ensuring responsive design and accessibility for authentication forms.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves refactoring authentication pages to use a shared layout while maintaining a simplified interface. The complexity comes from balancing consistency with the need for a focused auth experience, but the implementation follows standard UI refactor and accessibility practices."
