# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Voice Recording Button [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user interface component for starting and stopping voice recording, ensuring accessibility and clear user feedback.
### Details:
Develop a visually distinct button that toggles recording state. Integrate with browser microphone APIs to initiate and stop audio capture. Ensure the button reflects the current recording status (e.g., active/inactive).

## 2. Implement Recording State and Status Display [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Manage and display the current recording status (e.g., idle, recording, completed) to the user in real time.
### Details:
Use application state to track recording status. Display clear indicators (such as text or icons) reflecting whether recording is in progress, paused, or finished.

## 3. Integrate Real-time Speech-to-Text Conversion [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Convert recorded audio to text in real time using the Web Speech API or equivalent, and display the transcript as the user speaks.
### Details:
Connect the audio stream to a speech recognition service. Continuously update the transcript display as new speech is recognized.

## 4. Handle Microphone Permissions and Error States [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Request microphone access from the user and gracefully handle permission denials or technical errors.
### Details:
Implement logic to prompt for microphone access. Display informative error messages if access is denied or if technical issues occur.

## 5. Synchronize UI Updates and Finalize Recording Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Ensure seamless synchronization between recording controls, status indicators, and transcript display, and finalize the recording session cleanly.
### Details:
Coordinate UI components so that stopping recording finalizes the transcript and resets the interface for the next session. Prepare the transcript data for downstream features (e.g., editing or saving).
