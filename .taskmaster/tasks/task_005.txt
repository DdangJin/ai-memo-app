# Task ID: 5
# Title: 메모 CRUD 기능 구현
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: 메모 생성, 읽기, 수정, 삭제 기능 구현, API 엔드포인트 생성
# Details:
메모의 기본 CRUD 기능을 구현합니다. RESTful API 엔드포인트를 생성하고 프론트엔드에서 메모를 관리할 수 있는 기능을 제공합니다.

# Test Strategy:
CRUD 기능 테스트, API 엔드포인트 테스트, 에러 처리 확인

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Memo Data Model and API Specification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the Memo data structure and specify RESTful API endpoints for create, read, update, and delete operations, including request/response formats and error handling conventions.
### Details:
Establish the fields for the Memo entity, determine endpoint URLs and HTTP methods (e.g., POST /memos, GET /memos/:id), and document expected status codes and error responses.

## 2. Implement Memo CRUD API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop backend logic and controllers for memo creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion, ensuring proper integration with the database and adherence to the API specification.
### Details:
Use the chosen backend framework to implement endpoints, connect to the Memo model in the database, and handle input validation and error scenarios.

## 3. Integrate Authentication and Authorization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Ensure that all memo CRUD endpoints are protected so only authenticated users can access and modify their own memos.
### Details:
Apply authentication middleware to endpoints, verify user identity, and enforce ownership checks for memo access and modification.

## 4. Develop Frontend Memo Management Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Implement frontend components for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting memos, connecting to the backend API and providing a user-friendly interface.
### Details:
Build UI forms and lists for memo operations, handle API requests and responses, and provide feedback for success or error states.

## 5. Test and Document Memo CRUD Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of all CRUD operations and document API usage, error cases, and frontend workflows for future maintenance.
### Details:
Write integration and acceptance tests, prepare API documentation, and ensure all features meet requirements and handle errors gracefully.
