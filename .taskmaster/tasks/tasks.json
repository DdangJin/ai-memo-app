Include:\n   - Interactive charts (line, bar, pie, funnel) for each metric\n   - Filters for date range, category, and user segment\n   - Summary cards for key statistics (e.g., total memos, active users)\n   - Export or download options for reports (CSV, PNG)\n   Follow best practices for dashboard usability: clear labeling, consistent color schemes, and accessible design[2][3][4].\n\n4. **Data Visualization Best Practices**: Choose appropriate chart types for each metric (e.g., funnel for user flow, line for trends), group related data logically, and provide tooltips or drill-downs for deeper analysis. Ensure the dashboard is intuitive for both technical and non-technical users[2][3].\n\n5. **Security and Access Control**: Restrict access to analytics endpoints and dashboard views based on user roles (e.g., only admins can see all-user stats; regular users see only their own data).\n\n6. **Documentation**: Document API endpoints, dashboard features, and usage instructions for both end users and administrators.",

Use Next.js's built-in dynamic import capabilities to split code at the route and component level for faster initial loads.\n\n2. **Image Optimization**: Replace static <img> tags with Next.js's <Image> component for all user-facing images. Configure image domains and sizes in `next.config.js` to enable automatic resizing, lazy loading, and WebP conversion. Audit the codebase for unoptimized images and convert or compress them as needed.\n\n3. **Vercel Deployment Configuration (Core Platform)**: \n   - Establish Vercel as the primary deployment platform for the Next.js 14 application, leveraging its native Next.js optimization features\n   - Add a `vercel.json` file to the project root to customize build and routing settings, optimized for Next.js 14 features such as App Router and Server Components\n   - Ensure `package.json` includes the correct build and start scripts (`\"build\": \"next build\"`, `\"start\": \"next start\"`)\n   - Set up environment variables in the Vercel dashboard, mirroring those in local `.env` files, with special attention to Supabase and Anthropic API keys\n   - Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments on push with preview deployments for pull requests\n   - Configure Vercel's serverless functions for optimal performance with the memo CRUD operations and AI integrations\n\n4. **Vercel Edge Cache Utilization**: Configure Next.js 14 middleware and Vercel Edge Functions to cache static assets and API responses at the edge where appropriate. Use HTTP cache headers (`Cache-Control`) for static resources and leverage ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for dynamic pages to balance freshness and performance. Optimize caching strategies for memo content and AI-generated summaries.\n\n5. **Monitoring Setup**: Integrate Vercel Analytics as the primary monitoring solution, complemented by additional tools such as Sentry for error tracking. Configure performance metrics, Core Web Vitals monitoring, and alerting for production deployments. Ensure that monitoring does not expose sensitive user data and complies with privacy requirements.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Document all optimizations, Vercel deployment steps, and monitoring setup in the project README or a dedicated deployment guide, emphasizing Vercel as the recommended production environment.",
