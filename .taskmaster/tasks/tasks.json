        "details": "1. **Page Structure and Route Setup**:\n   - Create a new page component at `app/categories/page.tsx` following Next.js 14 app router conventions\n   - Implement as a client component with `'use client'` directive for interactive functionality\n   - Import and utilize the shared Layout component to maintain UI consistency across the application\n   - Set up proper TypeScript interfaces for category data structures (id, name, description, color, createdAt, updatedAt)\n\n2. **Category Display and List Management**:\n   - Implement a responsive grid or list layout to display existing categories\n   - Show category information including name, description, associated memo count, and creation date\n   - Add visual indicators like color coding or icons for better category identification\n   - Implement loading states and empty state handling when no categories exist\n   - Add search and filtering functionality to help users find specific categories\n\n3. **Category Creation Functionality**:\n   - Design a modal or inline form for creating new categories\n   - Include form fields for category name (required), description (optional), and color selection\n   - Implement form validation with appropriate error messages\n   - Add color picker component for category customization\n   - Integrate with POST /api/categories endpoint for category creation\n   - Show success/error notifications after creation attempts\n\n4. **Category Editing and Management**:\n   - Add edit buttons/icons for each category in the list\n   - Implement inline editing or modal-based editing interface\n   - Allow users to modify category name, description, and color\n   - Integrate with PUT /api/categories/[id] endpoint for updates\n   - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions\n\n5. **Category Deletion with Safety Measures**:\n   - Implement delete functionality with proper confirmation dialogs\n   - Check for associated memos before deletion and warn users\n   - Provide options to reassign memos to other categories or delete them\n   - Integrate with DELETE /api/categories/[id] endpoint\n   - Handle cascade deletion scenarios appropriately\n\n6. **API Integration and Error Handling**:\n   - Create or utilize existing API endpoints for category CRUD operations\n   - Implement proper error handling for network failures and server errors\n   - Add loading indicators during API calls\n   - Use React Query or SWR for efficient data fetching and caching\n   - Implement optimistic updates for better user experience\n\n7. **Responsive Design and Accessibility**:\n   - Ensure the page works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices\n   - Implement proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support\n   - Use semantic HTML elements and proper heading hierarchy\n   - Add focus management for modals and form interactions",
        "testStrategy": "1. **Page Navigation and Layout Testing**:\n   - Navigate to /categories from the Layout component's navigation menu and verify the page loads correctly\n   - Confirm the Layout component is properly integrated with consistent header, navigation, and styling\n   - Test responsive design across different screen sizes and devices\n   - Verify accessibility features using screen readers and keyboard navigation\n\n2. **Category CRUD Operations Testing**:\n   - Test category creation with valid data and verify new categories appear in the list\n   - Test form validation by submitting empty or invalid category data\n   - Test category editing functionality by modifying existing categories\n   - Test category deletion with and without associated memos\n   - Verify confirmation dialogs appear for destructive actions\n\n3. **API Integration and Error Handling Testing**:\n   - Test all CRUD operations with network connectivity issues\n   - Verify appropriate error messages display when API calls fail\n   - Test loading states during API operations\n   - Confirm data persistence by refreshing the page after operations\n   - Test concurrent operations and data consistency\n\n4. **User Experience and Performance Testing**:\n   - Test search and filtering functionality with various category datasets\n   - Verify color picker functionality and visual category representation\n   - Test form interactions and modal behavior\n   - Measure page load times and API response times\n   - Test with large numbers of categories to ensure performance scalability\n\n5. **Integration Testing with Memo System**:\n   - Verify that categories created here are available in memo creation/editing forms\n   - Test the relationship between categories and memos\n   - Confirm category deletion handling when memos are associated\n   - Test category reassignment functionality if implemented",
