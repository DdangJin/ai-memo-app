# Subtasks:
## 1. Research Web Speech API Capabilities and Browser Support [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Investigate the features of the Web Speech API, focusing on the SpeechRecognition interface for speech-to-text, and document browser compatibility and limitations.
### Details:
Review MDN and other authoritative sources to understand the API's structure, available events, and browser support matrix. Identify any known issues or polyfills required for cross-browser functionality.

## 2. Design Basic Speech Input Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Define the core structure for integrating speech input into the application, including event flow and data handling.
### Details:
Outline the main components: initializing SpeechRecognition, handling start/stop, processing results, and managing errors. Specify how recognized text will be captured and passed to the application.

## 3. Implement SpeechRecognition Initialization and Event Handlers [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Develop the JavaScript logic to instantiate SpeechRecognition, configure settings, and set up event listeners for result, error, and status events.
### Details:
Write code to create a SpeechRecognition instance, set interimResults and language options, and implement handlers for onresult, onerror, onstart, and onend events.

## 4. Integrate Speech Input with UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Connect the speech recognition logic to UI elements, enabling users to start and stop recognition and view recognized text.
### Details:
Bind start/stop actions to buttons or other controls, and display interim and final recognition results in the interface. Ensure accessibility and clear user feedback.

## 5. Test and Validate Speech Input Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of the speech input feature, including browser compatibility, error handling, and edge cases.
### Details:
Execute test cases for various browsers, languages, and input scenarios. Validate error handling, fallback behavior, and integration with the rest of the application.
