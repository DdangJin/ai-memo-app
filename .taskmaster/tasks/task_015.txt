# Task ID: 15
# Title: 성능 최적화 및 배포 준비
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: 코드 분할, 이미지 최적화, Vercel 배포 및 Edge Cache 활용
# Details:
애플리케이션의 성능을 최적화하고 프로덕션 배포를 준비합니다. 코드 분할, 이미지 최적화, Vercel 배포 설정, Vercel Edge Cache 활용 등을 구현합니다. Vercel 플랫폼에 맞는 배포 환경을 구성하고, Edge Cache를 통해 글로벌 성능을 극대화합니다.

# Test Strategy:
성능 테스트, Vercel 배포 테스트, Edge Cache 동작 확인, 모니터링 설정 확인

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Code Splitting and Dynamic Imports [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply code splitting techniques and utilize dynamic imports to optimize JavaScript bundle size and improve initial load performance.
### Details:
Leverage Next.js's automatic code splitting for pages and use dynamic() for components that are heavy or not needed immediately. Ensure only necessary code is loaded per route or interaction.

## 2. Optimize Images for Production [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement image optimization strategies to reduce load times and bandwidth usage across the application.
### Details:
Use Next.js Image component for automatic resizing, format conversion, and lazy loading. Audit existing images for size and format, and replace or compress as needed.

## 3. Configure Vercel Deployment Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure the Vercel deployment environment tailored for the application’s production needs.
### Details:
Adjust Vercel project settings, environment variables, and build configurations. Ensure the deployment process is automated and repeatable.

## 4. Implement and Validate Vercel Edge Cache [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Enable and configure Vercel Edge Cache to maximize global performance and reduce latency for end users.
### Details:
Set up caching rules for static assets and dynamic routes as appropriate. Monitor cache hit rates and adjust cache-control headers for optimal results.

## 5. Conduct Performance and Deployment Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive performance testing and validate all optimizations and deployment configurations.
### Details:
Run end-to-end performance tests, monitor application metrics, and ensure all optimizations are effective in the production environment.
